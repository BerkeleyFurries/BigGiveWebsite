        <li>Currency is in USD</li>
        <li>You own all rights associated with the art reward. However, artists reserve the right to post them for advertisement or documentation purposes. (Except for the stickers - the artist/club owns the design.)</li>
        <li>There is no limit to the number of times you can claim any reward(s). Only one reward can be claimed per donation. To claim multiple rewards, please donate multiple times. (Due to how UC Berkeley processes/counts donations, you must not use fursona names or duplicate identical personal/payment information. We can not guarantee that reward claims made under duplicate email addresses or non-human names will be honored.)</li>
        <li>Unless otherwise stated, all rewards are single-character. If you desire multi-character pieces, you may donate multiple times and specify in the redemption(s).</li>
        <li>NSFW rewards can only be redeemed by contacting the artist with proof of age (i.e., ID) first. Exercise common sense. (E.g., no underaged characters or any situations that break the law/Geneva Convention.)</li>
        <li>Please refer to the latest edition of IRS Publication 526 for details on the tax benefits/deductibility associated with any donations that you make (You will receive a confirmation email from UC Berkeley containing the appropriate tax information after donating)</li>
        <li>Donations have to be made between 9 pm March 12th and 9 pm March 13th to be eligible for reward redemption</li>
        <li>The reward redemption period is 9 pm March 12th to 11:59 pm April 12th</li>
    </ol>
    <p> (This TOS may be overridden by individual artists' personal TOS)</p>
